Coffee House

This project is done using HTML and CSS and is about a coffee shop
The entire project took me around five consistent days. 
I have learned a lot about design and layout in both HTML and CSS.
I feel confident in writing HTML so far.
However, I still struggle to grasp a few concepts in CSS, them being positioning and media query. This is my first serious project so I believe by end of December I will be better at those two.
Thank you for taking the time to read this.
